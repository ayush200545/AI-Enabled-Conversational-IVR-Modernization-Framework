🎙️ AI-Enabled Conversational IVR Modernization Framework

AI-Enabled Conversational IVR Modernization Framework is an open-source solution to modernize traditional Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems with AI-driven conversational capabilities — enabling natural language-based customer interactions instead of rigid menu options.

This framework leverages speech recognition, NLP, and intent understanding to create intuitive voice experiences for users.

🚀 Overview

Modern Conversational IVR replaces outdated IVR menus with natural language dialogues, so callers can speak their requests naturally and receive intelligent, contextual responses — improving customer experience and reducing complexity in support workflows.

This repository provides the foundation for:

AI-powered interactive voice response flows

Conversational speech handling

Integration with voice platforms or telephony services

Intelligent call routing and fallback logic

📌 Features

✔ Natural Language Understanding (NLU) for call comprehension

✔ Speech-to-Text (ASR) for capturing caller voice input

✔ Context-aware bot replies and follow-up logic

✔ Easy integration with backend APIs and systems

✔ Modular architecture for expanding IVR capabilities

🧠 How It Works

1. Voice Input
User speech is captured and converted to text using ASR.

2. Intent Processing
NLP models identify the user intent and relevant entities.

3. Conversation Manager
The system routes the call or generates a response based on logic.

4. Output Response
AI replies via Text-to-Speech back to the caller.

5. Escalation
For unresolved intents, calls can be escalated to live agents.

This flow mimics natural conversations and reduces caller frustration from rigid menus.
